I am a mathematician with research interests in the geometry, arithmetic and dynamics of discrete groups as well as in applications of geometry and topology to machine learning and computer science. Starting Fall 2023, I am a Mendelzon-CLTA Assistant Professor in Mathematics at the [Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences of the University of Toronto Scarborough](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/cms/). Previously I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto, a permanent Research Scientist at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems (Moscow), Assistant Professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, and a Postdoctoral Fellow at Skoltech (also Moscow).

In 2019, I got my PhD under the supervision of [Professor **Ernest B. Vinberg**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Vinberg) (see also [here](http://www.ams.org/distribution/mmj/vol8-4-2008/vinberg-birthday.html)). Here you can find my CV, papers, information about my projects and the materials of my teaching courses.

I am one of the organizers of the [Vinberg Distinguished Lecture Series](https://vinberg.combgeo.org/). <br><br><br>
