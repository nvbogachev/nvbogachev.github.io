I am a mathematician with research interests in geometry, arithmetic and dynamics of discrete groups. Starting Fall 2023, I am a Mendelzon-CLTA Assistant Professor in Mathematics at the [Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences of the University of Toronto Scarborough](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/cms/). Before that I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto.

I am one of the organizers of the [Vinberg Distinguished Lecture Series](https://vinberg.combgeo.org/).
